**The TikTok data team seeks to construct a classification model that will predict the status of claims made by users. Since the end goal is to classify claims and opinions, itâ€™s important to build a model that shows how to predict the behavior of the account type (verified) that tend to post more opinions.**<br>

   *As a member of the data team , starting with Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization , I conducted a Hypothesis test to analyze the relationship between the variables verified_status and video_view_count to find out whether there is a fundamental behavioral differences between the two groups of accounts: verified and unverified, and then I built a Logistic regression model that predicts verified_status based on video features.*
